Welcome to Team 10's website! We're designing and developing ClockAide.

ClockAide is an interactive educational system devised to help a specific group of students with special needs from West Springfield Middle School learn how to read and set time. In addition, the device provides the students with a quiet environment to practice entering their lunch identification numbers. The design stemmed from a [presentation given by their teacher, Megan Ferrari, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst]({{ root_url }}/assets/WestSpringfieldMiddle.pdf). She often encounters obstacles when trying to teach her students how to tell time and proposed our team to take lead on finding an innovative solution to assist her. The students learn how to tell time using our three - mode system which prompts them with questions of varying difficulty. Our electronic device will be a simple and user friendly device that will ultimately allow students of all levels how to read and set any analog clock.
