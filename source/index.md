Welcome to Team 10's website! We're designing and developing ClockAide.

The goal of ClockAide is to assist special needs students who are learning how to tell time. The design idea stemmed from a presentation given by a teacher from West Springfield Middle School at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She introduced several problems she encountered while teaching her students and asked the Senior Design Project teams if there were any innovative ideas to assist her in dealing with these issues. To accomplish this, we have designed a three-mode system in which the student will be able to learn setting and reading time. They will also be able to ask the device itself what the current time is. We will create an electronic device that will be simple and ultimately teach students of all levels how to read and set any analog clock.
